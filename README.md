                                   ======================
In what ways are you classes gamified? What game mechanics and design elements could be used and how might they improve your courses delivery, or to promote greater engagement or participation?

It can be seen that some of my classes have been gamified. Activities and scheduling are an important part in all of my modules. These are both elements of game mechanics. As students we are motivated to achieve our reward in terms of credits, which will enable us to get our degree. There are also rules which we as students are aware of, and are another element of gamification. These rules include attending classes, punctuality, written reports and participation in class. A points system is used for students to gain the credits we need to pass modules. These are even divided up into sub-sections similar to different levels in games. The points that are required for each assessment are made accessible to students, and could also be viewed as being game rules.

Perhaps greater use of game mechanics could be used in some modules through clearer use of progression as a feature of game mechanics. This may encourage greater student participation. Feedback from instructors would also act as a means of reward for students, while also acting as a useful tool for future study and work. The use of badges to recognise and reward good work of effort on behalf of students would also be helpful , which could perhaps be used on Blackboard, so students would have a clearer indication of their progression and development.
